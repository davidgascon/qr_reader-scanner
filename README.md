# qr_reader-scanner

Steps to develop.
1. Create a way to create a blank signature card (PIL)
2. Create a way to create (insert number here) number of 'fake' signature cards including some distortion to replicate a real scan. Save them in a folder. Also add a checkbox to add qr code/barcode
3. Figure out how to scan each file, then move file to appropriate folder.
